Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Michael Kaminski, I'm a self-taught programmer and a full-time University student living in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I'm still early in my coding journey - only having started learning since the start of 2022 in January with my intro to Javascript, but I'm eager to continue the process!

My current focus on my programming journey is to continue to further refine my understanding of Javascript and more specifically Next.JS, as well as improve my ability to work with JSX and CSS technologies like Tailwind. 

Over the coming weeks and months you can expect to see more projects uploaded to my Github, more importantly, these projects will be done by me - if you have any tips for me I would love to hear them!

Cheers!
Michael
