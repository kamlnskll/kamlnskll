Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Michael Kaminski, I'm a self-taught programmer living in Winnipeg, Manitoba and a full-time student at the University of Manitoba in the Asper School of Business, having done a semester at Waseda University.

Currently my stack is both Javascript and Typescript and the MERN stack, but plan on learning other languages in the near future. I'm also studying algorithms in my free time when not working on projects. If you're interested, feel free to check in on my progress here or on LinkedIn!

Cheers!

-Michael
